/*
 * Dry convective adjustment — Manabe & Strickler (1964).
 *
 * Ported from the family's shared planet/ConvectiveAdjustment.h (ATURAN/ATJUP/ATSAT), whose
 * header comment is the reference for why a model needs this at all and is worth reading. The
 * two properties that matter: it removes the instability COMPLETELY rather than damping it, and
 * it does not create or destroy energy.
 *
 * WHY ATHAD NEEDS IT, SPECIFICALLY. Until now ThermoAtm::densities() overwrote t with its own
 * adiabat every iteration, so the column could not go unstable — the prescription was doing the
 * convective adjustment's job, invisibly. README item 7 measured what that costs: with
 * ATM_PROGNOSTIC_T=1 the energy imbalance falls from -433 to -19 W/m2, but the lower column then
 * cools at 5.97 K/km against a 4.19 K/km dry adiabat (superadiabatic, i.e. convectively
 * unstable) and the top 50 km develops a grid-scale sawtooth. Radiative equilibrium in an
 * optically thick atmosphere IS superadiabatic; nothing else in this model restores a column to
 * its adiabat. This file is the prerequisite for finishing item 7.
 *
 * WHAT WAS NOT COPIED, AND WHY. The shared file is deliberately byte-identical across the
 * planets that use it, and two of its assumptions do not hold here:
 *
 *   1. IT ASSUMES A UNIFORM GRID. `dz_m = L_atm*1e3/(im-1)` is a layer thickness only when the
 *      layers are equal. ATHAD's radial coordinate is exponentially stretched — dz runs from
 *      0.81 km at the surface to ~15 km at the lid, a factor of 19 — so a single critical drop
 *      would be ~19x too strict at the bottom and far too lax at the top. This is the same
 *      defect class as init_tropopause_layers' round(h/L_atm) (CLAUDE.md): a height-to-index
 *      conversion that is only valid on a uniform mesh. The critical drop is therefore computed
 *      PER LAYER from get_layer_height(), and the segment adiabat becomes a cumulative sum
 *      rather than a linear ramp.
 *
 *   2. IT ASSUMES A CONSTANT cp_mix. ATHAD's cp varies by a factor of two across 300-1500 K and
 *      follows the composition, so cp is taken locally from AtmMixture::cp_of() at each layer —
 *      which is strictly better than the shared file's constant and is the reason its own
 *      comment warns not to substitute a textbook value.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, carried over unchanged: it mixes temperature only, not
 * composition, and it uses the DRY adiabat even where cloud is present. A moist adjustment would
 * use the saturated lapse — ATHAD_COND has SaturationH2O::moistLapse for exactly that — but that
 * is a modelling decision with consequences for the microphysics already running in the
 * saturation adjustment, and it is not made here.
