# ATHAD

**Atmosphere of the Earth in the Hadean Eon.**

An atmospheric general-circulation model of the Earth at ~4.4 Ga: a finite-difference
Navier–Stokes solver on a spherical shell with RK4 time integration and vertical
coordinate stretching, applied to a ~250 bar, water-vapour-dominated atmosphere over a
molten or quenching surface with no topography.

ATHAD is the atmosphere half of [ATOM_Precipitation](https://github.com/RogerGrundmann/ATOM_Precipitation)
(forked at `1e3f319`) re-based onto Hadean conditions. It keeps that model's turbulence
closures (k-ε, k-ω, k-ω SST), saturation adjustment, Zero/One/Two/Three-Category ice
schemes, moist convection and multi-layer radiation, and replaces everything that was
calibrated to a 1 bar, 288 K, N₂/O₂ Earth.

## Repository layout

```
atmosphere/   C++ source — the atmosphere model
cli/          Command-line interface source and config file
lib/          Shared utilities (arrays, geometry, …)
python/       Python bindings (Cython)
test/         Self-tests
tinyxml2/     Embedded TinyXML-2 XML parser
param.py      Parameter definitions (generates .inc, .pxi and .xml at compile time)
Makefile      Top-level build file
CLAUDE.md     Project constants, invariants and open risks
```

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Notes |
|---|---|
| g++ ≥ 7 or clang++ ≥ 6 | C++17 required |
| OpenMP | Typically ships with the compiler |
| Cython, Python ≥ 3.6 | Only for the Python interface |

## Build

```bash
make had          # the CLI executable, cli/had
make all          # CLI + Python extension
```

## Run

```bash
cd cli && OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 ./had config_athad.xml
```

Output lands in the directory named by `<output_path>` (default `output-Hadean/`)
as ParaView `.vtk` slices and `.vts` panoramas.

## Configuration

`cli/config_athad.xml` is generated from `param.py` and carries every parameter with
its default and a description. You need only include the entries you want to change;
everything else falls back to the compiled default.

## Hadean conditions

Surface pressure 250 bar, surface temperature ≈ 1500 K, mean molar mass 21.43 g/mol,
R_mix = 387.9 J/(kg·K), surface density 43 kg/m³. Composition by mole fraction:
80 % H₂O, 10 % CO₂, 3 % N₂, and 1.4 % each of CH₄, NH₃, H₂, CO and SO₂. H₂O and CO₂
are prognostic; the rest are a fixed well-mixed background.

Full constants, the three model invariants, and the assumptions that are still open
are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Status and limitations

Under construction. This section records what has actually been measured — including
the measurements that did not work out — rather than what is intended.

1. **Bootstrap (done).** The tree builds and links as `libathad.a` + `cli/had`.
   Hydrosphere, paleogeography and the NASA/Scotese data pipeline are removed.

2. **Flat surface (done).** `init_topography()` prescribes `h ≡ 0`,
   `i_topography ≡ 0`; the run reports 65341 surface points, all water. The surface
   temperature is prescribed from `t_surf_equator` / `t_surf_pole` (1500 K / 1450 K,
   area mean 1483 K) instead of read from a paleo curve. A 2-iteration run completes
   and writes 20 ParaView files, **bit-identically at 1, 4 and 8 OpenMP threads**.

   Three defects had to be fixed to get there, all inherited and all latent on Earth:

   - `MoistConvection::findCloudBaseLFS` indexed `t.x[-1][j][k]`. Its scan for
     `p_stat <= 1000 hPa` leaves the index at its `-1` sentinel when no level
     qualifies; the two other consumers of that index guard the sentinel, this one
     did not. Latent on Earth (p_surf ≈ 1013 hPa always fires by level 1), live on a
     column that sits entirely above 1000 hPa.
   - `AtomUtils::GetMean_2D/3D` built the global `m_node_weights` lazily with
     `clear()` + `push_back()`. `printDataAtm()` calls them from ~9 concurrent OpenMP
     sections, so the first call raced several threads through the same reallocation
     and corrupted the heap. It was masked in the parent only because an earlier
     single-threaded `GetMean_2D(temperature_NASA)` happened to run first.
   - `get_temperatures_from_curve()` dereferenced `begin()` and decremented `end()`
     *before* its own `size() < 2` guard — undefined behaviour on an empty map, which
     is what every call became once the Scotese curves were gone.

   The Makefile also gained `-MMD -MP` header dependencies; without them, edits to
   the headers where nearly all the physics lives did not trigger a rebuild.

   **What is not yet right.** The physics is still Earth physics on a 16 km shell.
   The column mean settles near 332 K and the prescribed 1500 K survives only at the
   domain top, because radiation still relaxes toward an Earth-like target, the
   saturation formula is still Magnus (capped ~101 °C), and the shell is ~20× too
   shallow for a 250 bar atmosphere. Deep convection is inactive: its trigger
   thresholds (1000/970/900/800 hPa) are absolute Earth surface pressures and never
   fire here. Phases 2–5 address these.

*(Further entries are added as each phase is measured.)*
